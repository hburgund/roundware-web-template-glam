						About The Work
					</Typography>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<em>Family Association</em> is a 16-minute site-specific, geolocation-enabled
							piece that uses collected oral history recordings from five members
							of the Chinese-American community as part of an interactive
							soundwalk in Manhattan's Chinatown.
						</li>
						<li>
							In <em>Family Association</em>, you will hear interviewees' memories
							of their extended families, how their families emigrated to the United States,
							and whom they imagine their ancestors to be â€” including those who left
							their homeland to seek a new future in the U.S. decades
							(and perhaps centuries) ago.
						</li>
						<li>
							Using GPS technology, the work embeds the audio within sites of
							various "family associations" in Chinatown; such associations have
							created tight-knit, supportive, social, and imagined communities
							based on a common family name. These associations in the neighborhood
							serve as a way for you to interact with the stories that you hear.
						</li>
					</ul>

						How To Listen
					</Typography>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Note: Please be careful of your surroundings and traffic at all times as you listen!</strong></li>
						<li>
							To experience the work, begin by heading to Manhattan's Chinatown.
							We recommend beginning at the intersection of&nbsp;
							<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/75TJtnciDh5YZGWS7">Mott Street and Bayard Street</a>.
						</li>
						<li>Once you are within range, hit "Play" and freely explore the neighborhood as you use the app.</li>
						<li>
							As you approach one of these family associations, the speech becomes
							more whole, recalling the way in which these micro-communities have
							helped generations of Chinese-Americans to both reconstruct and
							reconnect with their past.
						</li>
						<li>
							Over the course of the 15-minute experience, the recorded testimony
							gradually focuses on the interviewees' vision of their legacy
							for the next generation.
						</li>
					</ul>

						<br />
						Share Your Thoughts
					</Typography>
					<ul>
						<li>
							We would love to hear your thoughts! At the conclusion of the
							experience, you will have an opportunity to record your own
							reflections of Chinatown. Your real-time location will be recorded,
							and your reflections may be incorporated into a future version
							of the app. (Please note that you must be at least 18 years old
							or have the permission of a parent/guardian in order to submit a
							recording.)
						</li>
						<li>
							We also invite you to complete a brief, anonymous survey at the
						 	end of the experience to share your thoughts with us.
						</li>
